## Getting Started

First, you need to install Node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that runs on the server side. This project requires Node.js to run.

### Install Node.js

Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the version that fits your operating system. The website provides installation guides. After installation, you can check if it was successful by running `node -v` in the command line, which should return the current Node.js version.

### Run the Development Server

After installing Node.js, start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
